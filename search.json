Methodologically, I draw on recent advances in econometrics as well as tools from machine learning and AI to provide rigorous empirical insights.\nIn addition to my primary research, I have a secondary interest in urban and housing economics, where I study the determinants of housing instability and evaluate policy interventions aimed at preventing precariously housed individuals from becoming homeless."
